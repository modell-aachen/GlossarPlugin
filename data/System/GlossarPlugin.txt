---++ Usage
---+++ Defining a custom =VIEW_TEMPLATE= for entries
You can define a custom =VIEW_TEMPLATE= for entries by naming it according to the form attached to the entry (eg. if you use _GlossaryForm_ name your template _GlossaryViewTemplate_). This template should be based on =GlossaryPopup= (which is based on =view=).%BR%
Example:
<pre>
%%NOP%TMPL:INCLUDE{"GlossaryPopup"}%

%%NOP%TMPL:DEF{"content"}%This is how %%NOP%QUERY{"keywords"}% was defined:

%%NOP%TEXT%
%%NOP%TMPL:END%
</pre>
%I% If you need to have different layouts for a normal view and a popup, you should redefine =PopupContent= instead of =content=.
